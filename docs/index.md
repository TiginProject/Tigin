Highly customisable server software for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, built from scratch in PHP.

If you're looking to PocketMine-MP, this is a fork of it.

- 🧩 **Powerful plugin API** - extend and customise gameplay as you see fit
- 🗺️ **Rich ecosystem** and **large developer community** - find plugins easily and learn to develop your own
- 🌐 **Multi-world support** - offer a more varied game experience to players without transferring them to other server nodes
- 🏎️ **Performance** - get 100+ players onto one server (depending on hardware and plugins)
- ⤴️ **Continuously updated** - new Minecraft versions are usually supported within days

## ❌ Tigin is NOT a vanilla Minecraft server software.
**It is poorly suited to hosting vanilla survival servers.**
It doesn't have many features from the vanilla game, such as vanilla world generation, redstone, mob AI, and various other things.

If you just want to play **vanilla survival multiplayer**, consider using the [official Minecraft: Bedrock server software](https://minecraft.net/download/server/bedrock) instead of Tigin.

If that's not an option for you, you may be able to add some of Tigin's missing features using plugins from [Tigin Plugin Hub](https://tigin.org/plugins), or write plugins to implement them yourself.
