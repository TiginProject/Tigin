Code contributions must be submitted using [GitHub Pull Requests](https://github.com/TiginProject/Tigin/pulls), where they will be reviewed by maintainers.

Small contributions (e.g. minor bug fixes) can be submitted as pull requests directly.

Larger contributions like feature additions should be preceded by a [Change Proposal](#rfcs--change-proposals) to allow maintainers and other people to discuss and decide if it's a good idea or not.

## List of `pocketmine` namespaces which are in other repos
Tigin has several dependencies which are independent from the main server code. Most of them use the `pocketmine` namespace.
Some of these add extra classes to packages which already exist in Tigin.

Take a look at the table below if you can't find the class or function you're looking for.

| Source URL                                                      | Namespace, class or function                                                                                                             |

## Choosing a target branch
Tigin has three primary branches of development.

| Type of change                                                                                           | `stable` |          `minor-next`           | `major-next` |

### Notes
- **Non-disruptive** means that usage should not be significantly altered by the change.
  - Examples of **non-disruptive** changes include adding new commands, or gameplay features like blocks and items.
  - Examples of **disruptive** changes include changing the way the server is run, world format changes (since those require downtime for the user to convert their world).
- **API** includes all public and protected classes, functions and constants (unless marked as `@internal`).
  - Private members are not part of the API, **unless in a trait**.
  - The `pocketmine\network\mcpe` package is considered implicitly `@internal` in its entirety (see its [README](src/network/mcpe/README.md) for more details).
- Minecraft's protocol changes are considered necessary internal changes, and are **not** subject to the same rules.
  - Protocol changes must always be released in a new minor version, since they disrupt user experience by requiring a client update.
- BC-breaking changes to the internal network API are allowed, but only in new minor versions. This ensures that plugins which use the internal network API will not break (though they shouldn't use such API anyway).

## Making a pull request
The basic procedure to create a pull request is:
1. [Fork the repository on GitHub](https://github.com/TiginProject/Tigin/fork). This gives you your own copy of the repository to make changes to.
2. Create a branch on your fork for your changes.
3. Make the changes you want to make on this branch.
4. You can then make a [pull request](https://github.com/TiginProject/Tigin/pull/new) to the project.

## Pull request reviews
Pull requests will be reviewed by maintainers when they are available.
Note that there might be a long wait time before a reviewer looks at your PR.

Depending on the changes, maintainers might ask you to make changes to the PR to fix problems or to improve the code.
**Do not delete your fork** while your pull request remains open, otherwise you won't be able to make any requested changes and the PR will end up being declined.

> [!TIP]
> Don't worry about getting a PR perfect on the first try.
> In fact, it's quite unusual for a PR to be perfect when it's first submitted, and most PRs will get changes requested by reviewers, even when the PR is made by one of our team members.
>
> Mistakes are normal, and Tigin team members will review your code and suggest changes to your code as needed.
> Just make sure to stick with it so you can communicate with reviewers and/or make changes.

### Requirements
The following are required as a minimum for pull requests. PRs that don't meet these requirements will be declined unless updated to meet them.

- **All code must be licensed under the [LGPLv3 license](LICENSE) or a compatible license.**
- **Don't mix unrelated changes.** Unrelated changes should be submitted as separate PRs.
- **Don't make unnecessary changes.** Unnecessary changes make a PR harder to review, more likely to develop conflicts, and more likely to be declined.
- **Tell us what tests have been done.** Ideally, include PHPUnit tests in your PR. If that's not possible (e.g. for in-game functionality), give details about playtesting (e.g. screenshots and videos).
- **Code, comments and documentation must be written in American English.**
- **Code must be in the Tigin style.**
  - If you use PhpStorm, a `Project` code style is provided, which you can use to automatically format new code.
  - You can also use [`php-cs-fixer`](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) to format your code.
- **Use `final`, `private` and `readonly` wherever possible**. This allows us to change more things later on if needed without breaking plugins (including making things non-final, writable or increasing visibility).
- **Do not add unnecessary setters or public writable properties to classes.** Immutable things are preferred because their behaviour is more predictable. This isn't always possible, but preferred wherever possible.

### Recommendations
- **Be patient.** Maintainers are often unavailable or busy. Your PR might not receive attention for a while.
- **Start small.**
  - This helps you get familiar with the codebase, the contribution process, and the expectations of maintainers.
  - Check out ["Easy task" issues](https://github.com/TiginProject/Tigin/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Easy+task%22) on the issues page for something that you could tackle without too much effort.
- **Try to keep your PR diff small.** Small PRs can be reviewed and merged much more quickly than bigger ones.
- **Do not copy-paste other people's code (or code written by AIs like ChatGPT)**. You'll likely be asked to make changes by reviewers. If you don't understand the code you're submitting, your PR is likely to fail.
- **Do not edit code directly on GitHub.** We recommend learning how to use [`git`](https://git-scm.com).
- **Use an IDE, not a text editor.** We recommend PhpStorm or VSCode.
- **Do not make large pull requests without an RFC.**
  - Large changes should be discussed beforehand using the [RFC / Change Proposal](#rfcs--change-proposals) process.
  - Large changes are much harder to review, and are more likely to be declined if maintainers don't have a good idea what you're trying to do in advance.
- **Create a new branch on your fork for each pull request.** This allows you to use the same fork to make multiple pull requests at the same time.

**Thanks for contributing to Tigin!**

## RFCs / Change Proposals
Change Proposals are issues or discussions which describe a new feature proposal or behavioural change.
They are used to get feedback from maintainers and the community about an idea for a change, to decide whether it's a good idea.

### Submitting an RFC
RFCs should be submitted using Issues or Discussions.
RFCs _can_ be submitted as pull requests if you've already written the code, but this is not recommended, since it's not guaranteed that an RFC will pass, in which case your effort would be wasted.

RFCs should include the following:
- A summary of what you want to change
- Why you want to change it (e.g. what problems it solves)
- Alternative methods you've considered to solve the problem. This should include any possible ways that what you want can be done without the change.

### Voting on RFCs
Community members can vote on RFCs. This gives maintainers an idea of how popular the idea is.
Votes can be cast using :+1: and :-1: reactions.

**Please don't downvote without providing a reason why!**

### Implementing RFCs
Anyone can write the code to implement an RFC, and submit a pull request for it. It doesn't have to be the RFC author.

Implementations should be submitted as pull requests. The pull request description must include a link to the RFC.
